I am a Professor in the School of Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering at [UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/) and an internationally recognised researcher whose work focuses on robot navigation in many different areas, including search and rescue, underwater, underground mining, and surgery.

I am motivated by a desire to see robots collaborating with humans and helping people in their daily lives, and my work has made significant contributions to the fields of robot **simultaneous localisation and mapping**, **operations research**, **nonlinear state estimation**, and **nonlinear robust control**.

I have published more than 200 research papers and was named one of the 100 Most Influential Scholars in the field of Robotics by research profiler Aminer in 2018. 

Since 2007, as a Chief Investigator, I have secured external research funding worth more than $4 million including three ARC Discovery grants, three ARC Linkage grants, and one NHMRC Ideas grant.
