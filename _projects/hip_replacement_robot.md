## Research Overview

This project focuses on developing an innovative, cost-effective robotic system to assist surgeons in performing minimally invasive hip replacement surgery. The system aims to develop a low-cost minimally invasive robot system to assist with THR surgery that can automatically plan and prepare for the accurate placement of the components.



## Grants

This project is supported by 4 grants across the government and industries, including one grant supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Ideas Grant.



## Key Features

- **Minimally Invasive Approach**: The robotic system is designed to enable surgery through smaller incisions, leading to faster patient recovery and reduced complications.

- **Cost-Effective Design**: Innovative engineering solutions to reduce manufacturing and operational costs without compromising surgical precision.

- **Enhanced Surgical Precision**: Advanced control algorithms and real-time tracking ensure accurate placement of hip implants.

- **Surgeon-Centric Interface**: Intuitive user interface and control system designed with input from experienced orthopedic surgeons.

  

## Research Team

This project involves collaboration between UTS, The University of Edinburgh, RMIT University, and the experienced knee and hip clinicians at Concord Hospital.
