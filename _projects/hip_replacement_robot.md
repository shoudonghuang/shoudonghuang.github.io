  <h2>Research Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project focuses on developing an innovative, cost-effective robotic system to assist surgeons in performing minimally invasive hip replacement surgery. The system aims to develop a low-cost minimally invasive robot system to assist with THR surgery that can automatically plan and prepare for the accurate placement of the components.
  </p>

  <h2>Grants</h2>
  <p>
    This project is supported by 4 grants across the government and industries, including one grant supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Ideas Grant.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Minimally Invasive Approach:</strong> The robotic system is designed to enable surgery through smaller incisions, leading to faster patient recovery and reduced complications.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cost-Effective Design:</strong> Innovative engineering solutions to reduce manufacturing and operational costs without compromising surgical precision.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Enhanced Surgical Precision:</strong> Advanced control algorithms and real-time tracking ensure accurate placement of hip implants.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Surgeon-Centric Interface:</strong> Intuitive user interface and control system designed with input from experienced orthopedic surgeons.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Research Team</h2>
  <p>
    This project involves collaboration between UTS, The University of Edinburgh, RMIT University, and the experienced knee and hip clinicians at Concord Hospital.
