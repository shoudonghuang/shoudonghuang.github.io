## Research Overview

This project focuses on developing an innovative, cost-effective robotic system to assist surgeons in performing minimally invasive hip replacement surgery. The system aims to improve surgical precision while making robotic-assisted surgery more accessible to hospitals and patients through reduced costs.

## Grant

This project *Development of a Low-Cost Minimally Invasive Robot System for Hip Replacement* is supported by National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Ideas Grant.

## Key Features

- **Minimally Invasive Approach**: The robotic system is designed to enable surgery through smaller incisions, leading to faster patient recovery and reduced complications.
- **Cost-Effective Design**: Innovative engineering solutions to reduce manufacturing and operational costs without compromising surgical precision.
- **Enhanced Surgical Precision**: Advanced control algorithms and real-time tracking ensure accurate placement of hip implants.
- **Surgeon-Centric Interface**: Intuitive user interface and control system designed with input from experienced orthopedic surgeons.
