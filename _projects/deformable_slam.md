  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>(ARC Discovery Project DP201000982, Shoudong Huang, Liang Zhao, 2020-2022)</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    This project aims to investigate the problem of building a three-dimensional map of a deformable environment in real-time using images and at the same time localising the camera within the map. This project expects to generate new knowledge in the area of simultaneous localisation and mapping in deformable environments using vision and inertial sensors.
  </p>

  <h2>Research Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Fundamental Understanding:</strong> Generate in-depth understanding of the fundamental sensing requirements for the problem to be solvable
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Algorithm Development:</strong> Develop efficient algorithms for achieving accurate three-dimensional reconstruction of deformable environments
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Vision-Inertial Integration:</strong> Advance simultaneous localisation and mapping in deformable environments using vision and inertial sensors
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Real-time Performance:</strong> Achieve real-time mapping and localisation capabilities for dynamic environments
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Expected Outcomes</h2>
  <p>
    Expected outcomes include in-depth understanding of the fundamental sensing requirements for the problem to be solvable, and efficient algorithms for achieving accurate three-dimensional reconstruction of deformable environments.
  </p>

  <h2>Applications</h2>
  <p>
    The research outcomes from this project offer significant benefits to diverse areas such as <strong>minimally invasive robotic surgery</strong>, where understanding and mapping deformable tissues in real-time is crucial for surgical precision and patient safety.
