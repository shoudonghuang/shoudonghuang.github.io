## Robot Navigation and SLAM

Our research focuses on developing advanced algorithms for robot navigation and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). The main areas include:

### Search and Rescue
- Development of robust SLAM algorithms for search and rescue operations
- Real-time mapping in challenging environments
- Integration with human rescue teams

### Underwater Navigation
- Underwater robot localization and mapping
- Sonar-based navigation systems
- Marine environment exploration

### Underground Mining
- Safe navigation in underground mines
- Real-time tunnel mapping
- Autonomous mining operations

### Surgical Navigation
- Precise surgical tool tracking
- Real-time surgical scene reconstruction
- Computer-assisted surgical navigation
