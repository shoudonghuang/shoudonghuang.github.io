  Abstract= {Joint optimization of poses and features has been extensively studied and demonstrated to yield more accurate results in feature-based SLAM problems. However, research on jointly optimizing poses and non-feature-based maps remains limited. Occupancy maps are widely used non-feature-based environment representations because they effectively classify spaces into obstacles, free areas, and unknown regions, providing robots with spatial information for various tasks. In this paper, we propose Occupancy-SLAM, a novel optimization-based SLAM method that enables the joint optimization of robot trajectory and the occupancy map through a parameterized map representation. The key novelty lies in optimizing both robot poses and occupancy values at different cell vertices simultaneously, a significant departure from existing methods where the robot poses need to be optimized first before the map can be estimated. This paper focuses on 2D laser-based SLAM to investigate how to jointly optimize robot poses and the occupancy map. In our formulation, the state variables in optimization include all the robot poses and the occupancy values at discrete cell vertices in the occupancy map. Moreover, a multi-resolution optimization framework that utilizes occupancy maps with varying resolutions in different stages is introduced. A variation of Gauss-Newton method is proposed to solve the optimization problem at different stages to obtain the optimized occupancy map and robot trajectory. The proposed algorithm is efficient and converges easily with initialization from either odometry inputs or scan matching, even when only limited key-frame scans are used. Furthermore, we propose an occupancy submap joining method, enabling more effective handling of large-scale problems by incorporating the submap joining process into the Occupancy-SLAM framework. Evaluations using simulations and practical 2D laser datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach can robustly obtain more accurate robot trajectories and occupancy maps than state-of-the-art techniques with comparable computational time. Preliminary results in the 3D case further confirm the potential of the proposed method in practical 3D applications, achieving more accurate results than existing methods.},
